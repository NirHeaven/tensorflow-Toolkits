some useful toolkits wrapped from tensorflow API which includes some common nn models(such as resnet), nn layer operations(such as attention decoder), tensor operations(such as sparse) and some strategy to configure learning rate and optimizer. we also provide a pipeline to train nn models parallelly and easily
